This is my attempt to do text summarisation based on an article "https://stackabuse.com/text-summarization-with-nltk-in-python/"
I started exploring on this NLTK sub topic as i had touched upon this topic briefly through a course and a job description required this skill.

I have also recently chance upon the library spacy and am keen to look more into!
