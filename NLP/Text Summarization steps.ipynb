       "\"After Mewtwo rebuilds the laboratory and establishes a base there, he invites several trainers with hologram messages to battle the world's greatest Pokemon trainer at New Island. Departing with Mew and the clones, Mewtwo turns back time to just before the trainers leave Old Shore Wharf, and erases everyone's memories of the event. Escorted into the island's palace by the woman who appeared on the hologram, Ash and the other trainers who were able to reach the island encounter Mewtwo. All of the Pokemon originals battle their clones save for a defiant Pikachu and Meowth, who makes peace with his own clone after realizing the senselessness of their fighting. The storm outside clears up, Ash spotting Mew flying through the clouds and tells his friends of how he saw another legendary Pokemon the day he left Pallet Town. Mewtwo challenges the trainers using cloned Pokemon coincidentally modeled after the deceased friends from his childhood. After Mewtwo fully matures and awakens from a long slumber in a laboratory on New Island, he learns of his origin as Mew's clone from Dr. Fuji.\""
